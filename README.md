# MNIST Utils

This is a simple package for working with MNIST Images. If you have a physical mnist style gz file, you can use this package to load the images from the file. 

This is useful for when you want to run a trained model for example and provide a PNG to the model. The model likely is trained on a numpy array -> this just handles the conversion from PNG to grayscale numpy array.
